# Lab: Inventory and Order Management System

This project is a capstone lab for the DEMO3 (SQL module). It focuses on the design, implementation, and querying of a relational database for an e-commerce inventory and order management system. The work covers the full database lifecycle, from conceptual design to advanced SQL analysis.

## Database Design (ERD)

As part of the database design phase, I created an **Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD)** that represents the structure of the database schema, including entities, attributes, and relationships.

The ERD is provided in **two formats** for clarity and accessibility:
- **PDF version** – suitable for detailed review and documentation
- **PNG version** – For quick reference and visualization

Both versions illustrate the normalized schema (3NF), primary and foreign keys, and the relationships between customers, products, inventory, orders, and order items.

## Schema Implementation (DDL)

The database schema was implemented using SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements. 

We created all tables defined in the ERD, specifying appropriate data types, and enforcing data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, NOT NULL constraints, and CHECK constraints. 

The resulting schema ensures a normalized structure and consistent relationships between the tables: customers, products, inventory, orders, and order items.

## Step 3: Business KPIs and Advanced SQL Queries

To evaluate the performance of the system, several business Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using SQL queries. 

Aggregations, joins, and filtering conditions were used to extract meaningful metrics from transactional data.
